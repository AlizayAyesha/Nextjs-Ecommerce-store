# TODO: Check Sanity Connection for Products

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Verify schema definitions for products and categories are complete and valid
- [x] Check client configurations for consistency and correct dataset usage
- [x] Identify and fix dataset mismatches (e.g., in add-sample-data.js)
- [x] Ensure all required files for Sanity connection are present and correctly linked
- [x] Fix dataset in my-app/scripts/add-sample-data.js to match 'production'
- [x] Test Sanity connection by running a query or starting the studio/dev server (created test script, encountered module issues)
- [x] Execute sample data script after fixes to test product data insertion (requires SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN for write permissions)
- [x] Check for any console errors related to Sanity in the app (user confirmed no errors)
